# Queues wth Stacks
Using the Stacks and Queues data structure with push and pop operations previous challenge, the task is to implement a queue using instances of stack data structure and operations on them.

## Challenge Description
Ensure that oldest entered element is always at the top of stack 1, so that deQueue operation just pops from stack1. To put the element at top of stack1, stack2 is used.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time/Space:
0(1)

## API
* enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
