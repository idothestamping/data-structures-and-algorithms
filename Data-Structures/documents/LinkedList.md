# Singly Linked List
Singly linked list allows you to traverse in one direction, mostly forward.

## Challenge Description
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time/Space:
- insert 0(1)
- includes 0(n)
- print 0(n)
- append 0(1)
- insertBefore 0(n)
- insertAfter 0(n)
- kth from the end 0(1)
- mergeList 0(n)

## API
insert - The value is inserted at the start of the list.
includes - Searching involves looping through the list.
print - Looping through all nodes.
append - We are just getting the tail to append the new node.
insertBefore - Looping through the list to find and insert the new value before the current value.
insertAfter - Looping through the list to find and insert the new value after the current value.
kth from the end - Takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.
mergeList -Takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
